**Background** 
Iuiga, an e-commerce platform launched in May 2017, offers high-quality home and living products sourced from China-based ODMs at transparent prices. After facing stagnating sales due to low brand awareness, Iuiga opened a pop-up store in May 2018 to boost its brand presence and customer engagement despite limited experience in physical retail.

**Problem statement**
The conclusions were derived based on the problems (and growth opportunities) for two main teams.
1. Device Usage
The software development team at IUIGA plans to launch new features for online channels. To do so, they asked the analysts to take a deeper dive into the device usage of online customers.
1.1. Obtain the daily number of customers using a PC and the number of customers using mobile devices to
buy an item online. Visualize the results for better understanding.
1.2. Try to discover any hidden patterns.
1.3. Statistically evaluate the observations based on the data?

2. Purchase Frequency 
The marketing team at IUIGA asks the analysts to analyze the frequency of a customers purchase from IUIGA.
2.1. Determine the number of purchases for each customer. What percentage of customers returned for a
second purchase? 
2.2. Is there a difference between the average number of purchases across channels? Explain it. Check your
hypothesis statistically. 
3. Use other statistics and metrics to investigate the frequency of purchases? 

**Strategic Comsiderations**
1. Investment in Physical Stores:
- Continued investment in physical channels is essential.
- Recommendations: Open more stores, increase product inventory, enhance customer service, and improve the shopping experience.

2. Limited Synergies Between Channels:
- Over 95% of customers exclusively purchase either online or offline, showing limited cross-channel interaction.
- There's an urgent need to integrate and blend online and offline channels seamlessly.

3. Addressing New-Age Customer Demands:
- Emphasize creating a fully integrated, seamless omni-channel experience.
- Focus on attracting channel-agnostic customers by improving online reach and experience.
